What hypotheses do we hope to prove? 
More NGO mentions in state media? Type of mentionâ€¦ more direct quotes in independent media? Topics covered different?


- Source vs. no source per publication @done
- Source type vs. publication @done

- Organizations vs. source type @done
- Organizations sourced vs. mentioned @done

- Topics + organization
- Topics with more NGO sources by type
- Which topics use direct quotes more


Which ones quoted more - which sources more
Which topics + organizaitons

Which topics have NGOs as sources more
Which topics quote specific NGOs more

OH NOES: Hisham Mubarak Center for Law

Simple, Murdie-like explanations of methods, relegating complicated stuff to the footnotes

Add reference to Bob:2005?


TODO: How are organizations used? Press release vs. website vs. quoted person (who - kind of person, spokesperson, activist, etc.) vs. just a mention (+some sort of international tie?)
TODO: Topics in articles where NGO is used as a source vs. just a mention; publications that use them as sources more - source:mention ratio - types of sourcing per publication - topics
LATER: Automate way of determining source usage? 

MAYBE: Use NLTK 3.0 in process_natural_language.py
MAYBE: Use NLTK instead of TextBlob in extract_pos.py

MAYBE: Stanford shift-reduce parser better than PCFG parse - open CoreNLP using a socket from Python and interact from there (via @johnb30)
