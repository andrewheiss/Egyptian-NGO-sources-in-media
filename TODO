Sources stuff
TODO: How are organizations used? Press release vs. website vs. quoted person (who - kind of person, spokesperson, activist, etc.) vs. just a mention (+some sort of international tie?)
TODO: Figure out sentence topics?
TODO: Automate way of determining source usage? 

MAYBE: Use NLTK 3.0 in process_natural_language.py
MAYBE: Use NLTK instead of TextBlob in extract_pos.py

MAYBE: Stanford shift-reduce parser better than PCFG parse - open CoreNLP using a socket from Python and interact from there (via @johnb30)
